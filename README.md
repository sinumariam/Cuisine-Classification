# Cuisine-Classification
Here I have developed a machine learning model that automatically determine the type of cuisine a restaurant offers based on available data. This approach leverages text preprocessing , TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and classification techniques.
In hospitality Industry, machine learning can help in adapting the changes in dining trends and cuisine preferences by continuously learning from new data.
Here I am sharing my recent work ‘Cuisine Classification’ which I completed as a part of my Machine Learning Internship.
